// After every change, you want to store a snapshot of what you've done
1. Add selected files for staging: git add <file name> or git add . (. represents current folder)
2. Commit changes to git: git commit -m "Add message here" (should be in present tense instead of past tense! Bc when you are working with other people, people know its an active file)
